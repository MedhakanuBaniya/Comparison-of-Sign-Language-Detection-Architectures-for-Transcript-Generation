# Comparison-of-Sign-Language-Detection-Architectures-for-Transcript-Generation
Conducted a study on multimodal deep learning for sign language recognition and translation. Integrated YOLOv8 for gesture recognition with vision transformers for translating gestures into text. Achieved high accuracy in both detection and translation, enhancing communication tools for the hearing-impaired.
